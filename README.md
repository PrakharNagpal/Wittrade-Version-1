## About the Project :thought_balloon:

Wittrade is an application which is made exclusively for college students to sell,rent and buy things from other students.

## Aim of the Project :world_map:

Our aim is to help college students save money by helping them buy/rent and sell within their college.Any student who has something he needs to sell can simply post an ad using a few simple steps  and a student buyer who needs the same thing can purchase it by contacting him through our app.Our app would become the point of contact between the buyer and seller.
We are also planning to add a wishlist feature wherein the user can save all the items he likes and wishes to purchase.
